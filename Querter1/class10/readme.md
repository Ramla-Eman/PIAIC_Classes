# :star2: @Batch 76 Class 10 - Python

## Today's Focus

**Python**
1. For loop
```students = ["Ali", "Osama", "Sara"]
for student in students:
    print(student)
```
2. While loop
```num =1
while num < 11:
  print(num)
  num = num + 1
```
3. Tuple
```colours_tuple = ("Green", "Yellow", "Red")
print(colours_tuple)
```
4. Set
```fruits_set = {"apple", "mango", "apple", "grapes", "apple"}
print(fruits_set)
```
5. Error handling(try, except)
```try:
    first_name = "Hamza"

    print(10 / 0)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

```
